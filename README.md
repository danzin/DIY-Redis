A Redis clone implemented in TypeScript to understand how caching systems work from the inside out.

### It is a work in progress.

#### The server listens for commands on the default Redis port 6379. It's compatible with all standard redis clients, tested and working with [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/connect/cli/).

## ðŸ›  Features

- `PING`, `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`
- [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/)  `XADD`, `XREAD`, `XRANGE` 
- `TTL` support with automatic expiration
- In-memory store with simple eviction logic
- Basic command-line interface

After recieving a command through redis-cli, the server parses it and responds with a proper [RESP](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/) response. All standard Redis formatting rules apply.
