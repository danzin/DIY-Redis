# DIY-Redis

DIY-Redis is a lightweight Redis clone written in TypeScript with Bun.
Itâ€™s built to learn the inner workings of caching systems â€” from parsing RESP commands to replication, persistence, and streams.

#### The server listens for commands on the default Redis port 6379. It's compatible with all standard redis clients, tested and working with [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/connect/cli/) in Ubuntu and Debian.

### ðŸš€ Running It
  ```bash 
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Usage 
```
$ redis-cli -p 6379
127.0.0.1:6379> PING
PONG

127.0.0.1:6379> SET foo bar
OK

127.0.0.1:6379> GET foo
"bar"
```

After receiving a command through redis-cli, the server parses it and sends a proper [RESP](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/) response. All standard Redis formatting rules apply.
